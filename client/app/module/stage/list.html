    The order of the workflow stages below will be reflected on the board from left to right and should
    represent YOUR workflow. You can re-order stages by dragging them. Only stages marked "Displayed on Kanban board"
    will be shown on the board, however all are listed here. Stages like <strong>Backlog</strong> for example are not
    normally displayed due to the volume of tickets assigned to that stage during ticket creation.
