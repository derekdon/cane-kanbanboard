<p>
    This project <a
        href="https://github.com/derekdon/cane-kanbanboard"><code>github.com/derekdon/cane-kanbanboard</code></a> is an
    open source single page Kanban Board application, build on a CANE stack (Couchbase, Angular, Node &amp;
    Express). The application is currently under rapid Lean style development and is not fully functional, and as such it is
    not suitable for production use until a release is tagged. For more information visit the <a
        href="https://github.com/derekdon/cane-kanbanboard">github repository</a>.
