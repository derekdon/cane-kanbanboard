# Kanban Board on a CANE Stack (Couchbase, Angular, Node, Express).

This project is an open source single page Kanban Board application, build on a CANE stack (Couchbase, Angular, Node,
Express). It is not built on top of a seed or a yeoman generator and is intentionally being hand rolled. The application
is currently under rapid Lean style development and is not fully functional, and as such it is not suitable for 
production use until a release is tagged.
